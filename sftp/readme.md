## Transfer files via SFTP

- [x] Login is hardcoded
- [x] Path descriptions added
- [x] Trivial function to append ~ to path locations.

### Working

Change hardcoded login details

Observe descriptions of file path for the get and put command.

Note that the local paths have to be given starting from current directory, ie, same directory as the script.
